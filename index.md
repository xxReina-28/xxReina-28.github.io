      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I build systems that make work easier. Clear workflows, structured processes,
        and tools that support people instead of complicating their jobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work sits between operations and technology. I translate messy real-world
        workflows into automation, documentation, and dashboards that leadership can trust.
        My background spans client services, BPO operations, and cross-functional teams
        across fintech, cybersecurity, and B2B environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        I prioritize clarity over complexity. If I cannot win the situation,
        I redesign the system that defines it.
