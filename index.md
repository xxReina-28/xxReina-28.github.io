## Hi, I’m Niña Peterine Sheen Suico (Reina)
  
Business Systems · Operations Automation · Analytics  

Open to opportunities worldwide. Relocation and remote.

I design systems that make work calmer, clearer, and more effective.
My focus is on structured workflows, automation that reduces manual effort,
and analytics that support better decisions.

I work at the intersection of operations, technology, and data.
If a system is inefficient, unclear, or fragile, I redesign the battlefield.

## What I Do

- Architect end-to-end business systems
- Automate operational workflows and recurring processes
- Design analytics that surface insight, not noise
- Document systems so they are scalable and maintainable

## How I Think

I prioritize clarity over complexity.
I design systems that can be understood, maintained, and trusted.
If I cannot win the situation, I redesign the system that defines it.
