### Niña Peterine Sheen Suico

I design systems that make work calmer, clearer, and more effective.

My focus is on structured workflows, automation that reduces manual effort,
and analytics that support better decisions across operations and client teams.

**Open to opportunities worldwide. Relocation and remote.**

## How I Work

- I prioritize clarity over complexity  
- I design systems that can be understood and maintained  
- I automate with governance and scalability in mind  
- I use data to support decisions, not overwhelm them  

If I cannot win the situation, I redesign the system that defines it.
